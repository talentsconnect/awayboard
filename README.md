# Awayboard

The "Awayboard" is a dashboard-like overview for teams, whose members may work remotely, 
to know which team member is working from where.

Draggable photo-like tiles of the team-members can be placed in columns
for office, homeoffice and away.
(the default columns, see also: [Configuration](#configuration))

## Installation
1. Build a docker image

    `$ docker build . -t awayboard `
    
2. Run it with published port.

    `$ docker run -p 5711:5711 awayboard`

Note: `-p` parameters: the first port number is the one on the local machine, the second one the internal one of the docker. 
The later can be changed in the Dockerfile.

## Configuration
In `conf.json` it is possible to configure the desired columns. Each one needs a title, a background-image and a symbol.
The symbol will be  shown in mobile views, instead of the title.

Although the Awayboard uses CSS Grids' `auto-fit` and a fractional width, a configuration with a lot of columns might not look usable.
Up to six columns were tested and look quite ok on a usual large screen.


## Usage
Enter a name in and an image-url (has to be somewhere online) in the fields below, then click "Add person".
A [placeholder image](https://spaceholder.cc) will be provided if no image-url was given.
Then drag your tile to the desired column.

After that, tiles are stored permanently. Later, every person may update their working status as they wish.


## Usage via API
An API with endpoints for reading, creating/updating and removing persons to/from the Awayboard is provided. 
By that, interaction via command-line or other tools is possible. Imagine an NFC-based "check-in-system" to the office or other cool applications ðŸ•¹.

## Browser support 

The following list shows browsers, in which the "Awayboard" was tested and appeared usable.

The "+" means, it is expected to keep on working in coming versions.

Missing browser support results out the use of the following feaures: 

* **CSS:**

    * [CSS Variables](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables)
    
    
* **ES6:**
    * [ES6 Template Literals](https://caniuse.com/#feat=template-literals)
    * `const` and `let`.
